	<p><strong>Emotional Intelligence is the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.</strong></p>
		<p>This means to have a good sense of judgment and a ready comprehension of other people's states.</p>
		
	<br>
	<p><strong><em>More importantly, how can we improve our emotional intelligence?</strong></em></p>
	
		<p><strong>Attention Training:</strong></p>
			<p>Become aware of yourself, your body, your emotions, your presence. This can help you better organize 
			your thoughts and attention.</p>
		<p><strong>Self Knowledge & Mastery:</strong></p>
			<p>Know what is occupying you internally, your mind importantly. This allows you to understand what's going on, 
			allowing you to be more present (and hopefully better engage) in the situation.</p>
		<p><strong>Creating Useful Mental Habits:</strong></p>
			<p>Habits are (almost) like functions! Usefully you can defend against what is known as
			the "Super Ego", the critical judging part of your mind. Defending against it while being present allows you to clearly
			see your strengths and weaknesses.</p>
	
	<br>	
	<p>Emotional intelligence has been studied to be influential for a lot of positive traits. Daniel Goleman, goes on about it's impact and the results of his studies, in his 1996 book. Goleman goes on to describes Emotional Intelligence.
	He found that many higher ups throughout society possessed a good grasping of skills that require emotional intelligence, furthermore he found that one can improve it to better themselves. In his experimental studies he found that
	emotional abilities influenced consumers when they were deciding to buy products. One would be foolish to dismiss this knowledge and not read more into it.</p>
