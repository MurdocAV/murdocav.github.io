	<h4>Using the Evidence gathered, describe your core personal values:</h4><br>
	<p>
		Commitment is a core value that I learned through trial and error. I have often done many projects and attempted lots of different studies, leaving them half completed.
		One of my best friends used to constantly call me out on it. It wasn't until he was no longer in my life that his lesson rang true for me. Not deciding is still a decision.
		In life and in the workforce, you need to be able to withstand a lot of criticism to get to the end goal. You need to be able to identify your core goal and ensure you're ready to sacrifice
		what's needed to achieve the goal. Evidence that made this lesson stick for me is the fact that during my attempts to make better plans a lot of people in my life criticized and actively
		discouraged me to complete my goals, ensuring it may be a waste of time. While they could have been correct, I saw praise at the end of the achievements I was completing.
		Praise was tangible enough to show me that the value of commitment is an important one. The lesson was continuing to search for a better career path rather than reserving myself to my old life with my old habits.
		The partying culture of peers discouraged me to make my decisions. And removing my-self to the point of being able to do enough work was the solution. I've never had any whanau,
		so commitment had to come from myself and any aid from lucky friends. Curiosity is a second value that is innate in me, since I was a little kid I loved reading books about technologies, space and science. I've always wanted to learn more and improve. Real improvement is one of the best feelings in the world. Consequently, it's not always the easiest. Often giving you a feeling of discomfort because you're outside of your knowledge zone.

	<h4>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations:</h4>	<br>
	
	<p>
		I remember in high school; our entire math's class would never listen to the teacher and just play around. I was social myself and never paid the up-most attention.
		Me and my two friends would just sit in class and chat about for the most part. One day the teacher told us it was an important lesson, I could see in his eyes that he was just trying to genuinely
		get us to pay attention because he thought it was important. My friend was talking to me about whatever fun thing he found out the day previous. Something clicked in me, I think I'd call it a realization
		of responsibility. I stopped talking to my friend that day and the three of us did the standard and got excellence and merits in the NCEA internal. Most of the class failed and I realized that responsibility
		wasn't all on the teacher, that we are accountable for our own actions. I emailed the teacher and thanked him years later, ended up having a coffee and he continued to go on about how his students were doing now.
		Not much changed sadly, but that math standard was linear equations, which demystified vectors for computer science papers when I attended university. I think another value I unknowingly engaged two years
		later was gratitude. That value I can't define so easily but thanking people sometimes makes me feel better, so it may be more selfish than I thought but I'm glad I listened that day rather than fool around.
		My strategy was to pay attention to my own learning and get involved and participate in my own future. There are physical limitations and I feel like I'm bound to rub up close to them in my learning process.
		But more often when I keep learning I find that the hurdle I thought was a limitation really wasn't and that I can push myself to learn more than I ever thought possible. I think engaging in own personal learning
		is an activity that embodies all my key strengths. Internalizing patience, determination, staying calm, working hard are all great strategies. And I ended up with none of my friends really criticizing me for making
		that decision in the end so my fear, which is a big personal weakness for me, was (then) conquered. My philosophy professors have ensured me that the right tool for the right job is important.
		Therefore, I like to maintain an active learning process in all values that have importance, not just my own. My limitations are my own time-management skills and previously commitment to the task at hand.
		I tend to look at my limitations as not currently my strengths yet. When I rub up against an adamant limitation in my knowledge, I'll know I've given it my all and that would be enough for me.
		That leads to one of my favourite quotes that Steve Jobs used in the end of his 2005 commencement speech. A man who had made many mistakes commented, "Stay hungry, Stay foolish".
		I think it means to always want to be better and know you're not the best.
