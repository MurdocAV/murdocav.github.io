What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
	It's not as big as I thought. I get tierd really easily from learning. But If I keep learning 
	past that It's not too bad. Just take breaks.
What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
	The core content is actually incredibly useful for turning yourself into a programmer,
	it all comes with habits.
What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
	Actually applying it to your daily life can be quite challenging but It's something I want 	to continue to improve at.
Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
	Because it's useful, and possibly more important than technical skills in the industries of 	today. Thank you guys for the pro-tips, keep the content coming!
Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
	Not at all, Once I push past the inital part, immersing yourself in the content is very 	easy, I find my self doing research on top of the normal content.
